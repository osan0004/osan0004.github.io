      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <img id="my-image" src="image/img_8440.jpg " alt="image of me">

      <p>
        When I was a child I always had a passion for talking, I know that might sound unsurprising for a child, but
        it's always come naturally to me. Whether it's talking on stage in front of hundreds of my peers, or debating on
        a topic with an <em>adult</em>. I've always found comfort in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast foward to today, the 23<sup>rd</sup> of May 2023, I would say that my childhood mindset and general outlook
        on things has greatly shaped who I am today and what I'm capable of. I personally did not participate, but my
        highschool had the privilege of competing in a number of debates and speaking competitions like The
        <abbr title="African Leadership Academy Model African Union">ALAMAU.</abbr>
        This sparked a fire in me and I strive towards this and greater.
